            We store basic account information (user name, e-mail). We store the documents you shared, comments, and likes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that until the document is published, it is only visible to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can always delete a document or the whole Callisto account from the <a href="{%url 'dashboard'%}"><i>Dashboard</i></a>.
            If you delete the Callisto account, all associated information (documents, comments, likes) will be purged as well.

            <p>
              Sharing a document is a two step process:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Start by uploading a document (either from file, or from the JupyterHub),
                </li>
                <li>
                  Next, use the <code>Publish</code> button from your <a href="{%url 'dashboard'%}"><i>Dashboard</i></a>.
                </li>
              </ol>
              When you publish a document you will have an opportunity to provide extra information. Other people
              will be able to discover it in the <i><a href="{%url 'document-index'%}">list of documents</a></i>, or
              in <i><a href="{%url 'search'%}">Search</a></i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you change your mind you can always update the document or its information, or delete it altogether.
            </p>
            <p>Check out this quick GIF below to see how it works in practice:</p>

          <p>
            Getting a notebook copied into your own JupyterHub session is a simple click.
            When you see a notebook on the <i>Callisto</i> that you'd like to run just press the <code>open as notebook</code>
            or <code>Open as JupyterHub</code> buttons which are on <i><a href="{%url 'document-index'%}">list of documents</a></i>.
            If your notebook directory already contains a notebook of the same name it will make sure to append the current
            date/time to the newly imported notebook, as to not overwrite the existing one.
          </p>
          <p>
            See the GIF below for an example:

            <h3 class="panel-title">Can I edit/delete documents I've shared?</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">
          <p>
            Yes, you can. Head to your <a href="{%url 'dashboard'%}"><i>Dashboard</i></a> (<code>My Documents</code> in the menu bar above).
            There you can <code>delete</code> a document or select <code>edit description</code> to change the tags/sources/description of a document you have published.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that the <code>edit description</code> does not give a way to edit the document itself, but just the associated metadata. To also replace the code document itself
            you will have to replace it as outlined above in <i>How do I share a document?</i>

          <p>
            We are grouping documents by their name.
            So if you are submitting a document called <code>mynotebook.ipynb</code>,
            but there is already another document of the same name we assume that your
            document is a (potentially edited) copy of this document.
            To keep things a bit more organized we are grouping these together and only list
            the oldest document with that name on the <i>Explore</i> page.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your document isn't an edited copy of an earlier document and you want to avoid
            being grouped with an existing document you should rename your document prior
            to publishing it.
